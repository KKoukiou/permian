# branchNameStrategy option determines how to approach a situation when the
# desired branch of the testplans library repository is not available.
# There are currently following strategies available:
#  * exact-match
#  * drop-least-significant
#
# exact-match
#  This strategy uses the branchNameFormat and doesn't allow fallback to any
#  other branch if the desired one is not available and fails.
#
# drop-least-significant
#  This strategy uses the branchNameFormat and if the desired branch is not
#  available tries another branch names continuously dropping the least
#  significat part of the version specification until branch of such name is
#  found (success) or until there's nothing more to drop (failure).
#  Example of branch names attempts is:
#   Foo-1.2-3 -> Foo-1.2 -> Foo-1 -> Foo -> (failure)
branchNameStrategy=drop-least-significant
# branchNameFormat option defines desired format of the branch that should be
# used when cloning the testplans library repository. Depending on the
# branchNameStrategy either branch of this format (or modified) will be used.
branchNameFormat={product}-{major}.{minor}
# Determines how test configurations of testplan and testcase are merged
# Default is intersection - which includes the CaseRunConfiguration in TestRun only if the configurations in testplan and testcase are identical
