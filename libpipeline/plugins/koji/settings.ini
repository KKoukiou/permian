# Koji hub URL. For Fedora it's https://koji.fedoraproject.org/kojihub
hub_url=
# Baseurl directory where composes entrypoints are located. The entrypoint
# files are text files which contain relative location of the compose
# that's associated to the Koji build. The entrypoint files are in form:
# 123-component_name where the 123 is Koji build id. Let's say there's a
# "foobar" component Koji build with build id 369 and the testcomposes_baseurl
# is set to http://example.com/toplevel/subdir, then the entrypoint file
# would be: http://example.com/toplevel/subdir/369-foobar. If such entrypoint
# would contain following content: "../../369-foobar-852" then the compose
# location would be: "http://example.com/toplevel/subdir/../../369-foobar-852"
# which would be translated by the HTTP server to:
# "http://example.com/369-foobar-852"
testcompose_baseurl=
# Number of seconds for which is waited for the test compose to be available.
# If the specified time is exceeded, ComposeNotAvailable exception is raised.
# Zero value denotes that no waiting is performed and the compose has to exist
# at the very moment when the compose is requested.
# Negative number can be used to specify infinite timeout.
testcompose_timeout=7200
# Number of seconds between attempts to locate the compose. The value follows
# semantics of python time.sleep => negative values are not allowed and zero
# value means the attempts will be repeated without any delay hammering
# the compose location server.
